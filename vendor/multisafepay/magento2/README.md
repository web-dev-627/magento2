The new plugin brings code improvements, unit/integration testing, and it is build on top of the Magento payment provider gateway structure.

## Module suite

The new MultiSafepay Magento 2 plugin consists of several modules:

* [multisafepay-magento2-core](https://github.com/MultiSafepay/magento2-core) (Provides core functionalities)
* [multisafepay-magento2-frontend](https://github.com/MultiSafepay/magento2-frontend) (Enables use of the payment gateways in the Magento checkout)
* [multisafepay-magento2-adminhtml](https://github.com/MultiSafepay/magento2-adminhtml) (Makes it possible to enable/disable payment gateways and change the settings in the Magento backend)
* [multisafepay-magento2-msi](https://github.com/MultiSafepay/magento2-msi) (Handles stock when MSI is enabled)
* [multisafepay-magento2-catalog-inventory](https://github.com/MultiSafepay/magento2-catalog-inventory) (Handles stock when MSI is disabled)
* [multisafepay-magento2](https://github.com/MultiSafepay/magento2) (Meta package which installs all the above)

For GraphQL support there is a separate module:
* [multisafepay-magento2-graphql](https://github.com/MultiSafepay/magento2-graphql) (Extends and adds GraphQL queries and mutations)

## Module dependencies
The meta-package has a dependency on MSI, which means that the MSI modules should be available (but not necessarily enabled) in your store. 

However, if you have removed it with, for example, a composer-replace trick like [yireo/magento2-replace-inventory](https://github.com/yireo/magento2-replace-inventory) or if MSI is not available because you are still running Magento 2.2, you will not be able to install the meta-package.
In this case it is still possible to integrate with MultiSafepay. 
You can then install the magento2-frontend module and the magento2-catalog-inventory module, instead of the meta-package.

The magento2-frontend module has a dependency on the magento2-core and magento2-adminhtml module, so they all will be installed.
And then you need to have a module which handles the stock in some specific cases. 
Since MSI is not available, you can install the magento2-catalog-inventory module instead.

The installation process is the same for the Magento Commerce version.

## Installation
If you are a developer, we recommend installing the various composer packages separately so that you can finetune which modules are needed and which are not.

For merchants, we recommend installing the complete package via composer:

```shell
composer require multisafepay/magento2
```

This will install all the different Magento 2 modules that support MultiSafepay.

Next, to enable all MultiSafepay modules, run the following:

    ./bin/magento module:enable `./bin/magento module:status | grep MultiSafepay_`
    
Next, run the following commands:
```shell
php bin/magento setup:upgrade
php bin/magento setup:di:compile
php bin/magento setup:static-content:deploy
```

### Stock handling

If you have disabled MSI inside Magento 2, then you can use the following command to disable the MultiSafepay MSI module:
```shell
php bin/magento module:disable MultiSafepay_ConnectMSI
```

If you have a Magento 2 installation with MSI enabled, you can use the following command to disable the MultiSafepay CatalogInventory module instead:
```shell
php bin/magento module:disable MultiSafepay_ConnectCatalogInventory
```

## Versioning
This package installs multiple modules that are available in other repositories via composer. 
Unlike the seperate modules it installs, it does not adhere to semantic versioning.
To find out which version you are running for the seperate modules, the following command can be used:
```shell
composer show -v | grep multisafepay
```
